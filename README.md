# Boo-Ya
Boo-Ya is about a ghost that scares residents in a haunted hotel. And tries to break a highscore doing so. But you must watch out to not get caught by the ghost hunters. This game made as a school group project by a group of 4 people, 2 programmers me and Lars Bracke and 2 artists Freija De Graeve and Pim Jacobs. I was in charge of all the code for the player and the ghosthunter. I also coded the UI and other small things to pollish and ship the game. The main challenges of this game were the npc behaviors. Because we needed to make sure the npc's did't feel too stupid but still felt fun to play agains.
The game is made with Unity and coded in c#. For the npc behaviors we used Behavior Bricks, a plugin to facilitate the making of the behavior tree. The camera shake was done with the Milkshake plugin. We also used an outline plugin to show an outline around objects you can interact with.
